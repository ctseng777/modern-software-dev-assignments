# Reflection: Syllabus Resources vs. Broader Ecosystem

I reviewed the resources listed in the https://themodernsoftware.dev/ syllabus and mapped each "element of software" (interpreted as each weekly theme) to:
1) products/repositories/solutions explicitly referenced in the lecture resources, and
2) additional products/repositories/solutions from the broader internet and open-source community.
